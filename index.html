        <h2>
            Lipsti.cc is a product studio born in the San Francisco Bay Area, launching worldwide.
        </h2>
        <p>
            We are driven by the belief that AI can serve as a catalyst for creative exploration, rather than a replacement for human ingenuity.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to build a future where technology and humans work together. We advocate for organizations to adopt AI as means of
            technological acceleration and not to fear it. We advocate for effective accelerationism. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, we are interested in building for education and learning. In the future, we plan on extending to puzzle games, utilities and tools, and more.
        <p>
            We are looking for funding and partnerships. If you are aligned with our vision for the future, reach out to <a href = "mailto:aarush@svbrain.xyz">aarush@svbrain.xyz</a>.
            If you are a builder that wants to launch with us, our accelerator program will be out of beta soon and dreamers are encouraged to apply. 
        </p>
