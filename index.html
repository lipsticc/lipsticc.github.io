        <h2>We build cool sh*t.</h2>
        <p>
            We are a venture studio that builds <b>experiences</b> and <b>tools</b> that inspire and help people.
            We are driven by the belief that AI can serve as a catalyst for <b>creative exploration</b>, rather than a replacement for human ingenuity.

            Lipsti.cc is an organization &mdash; contributors work on individual products and are free to leave and return for new ones.

            <p>
                TextbookGPT was a collection of AI agents built from scratch (chatbot, summaries, question generator, etc.) for a set of popular high school AP textbooks.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was based on a fine-tuned LLM and a custom data retrieval pipeline with heuristics tuned for each textbook.
            </p>
            <p>
                We built the data infrastructure and MLOps from scratch and self-hosted it in our own private server, for experimentation on truly owning our stack.
            </p>
            <p>
                We sunsetted the product at 1,000+ students and 24,000+ queries/month in ~1.5 months solely from word of mouth.
