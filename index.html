        <h2>
            Lipsti.cc is a product studio and consultancy born in the San Francisco Bay Area, launching worldwide.
        </h2>
        <p>
            We are driven by the belief that AI can serve as a catalyst for creative exploration, rather than a replacement for human ingenuity.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to build a future where technology and humans work together. We advocate for organizations to adopt AI as means of technological acceleration and not to fear it. We similarly advocate for effective accelerationism. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, we are interested in building to demonstrate the efficiency of large-scale and independent AI systems. Backed by grants and research programs, we feel confident in accelerating AI. 
        <p>
            If you are an AI company that wants to consult with our team, our consultancy program <s>will be out of beta soon</s> is now live and moonshot startups are encouraged to apply.

            <p><i>End-to-end generative AI art system and portfolio</i></p>
            <p>
                Decorus Media is an art portfolio on Instagram to display creative generative art. Decorus, in Latin, translates to beautiful, elegant, graceful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following lessons from TextbookGPT, we've finetuned LLaMA 3 on generating prompts for Stable Diffusion v2.1 and we plan to extend this system to v3 soon. All images are generated from a seed prompt and any following prompt engineering and parameter maniplation is left to the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                We aim to move towards an age where human creativity is leveraged by AI systems to assist in curation of art and culture.

                We're currently at 1,000+ students and 24,000+ queries/month in ~1.5 months solely from word of mouth.
