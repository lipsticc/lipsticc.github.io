        <h2>
            Lipsti.cc is a product studio and accelerator born in the San Francisco Bay Area, launching worldwide.
        </h2>
        <p>
            We are driven by the belief that AI can serve as a catalyst for creative exploration, rather than a replacement for human ingenuity.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to build a future where technology and humans work together. We advocate for organizations to adopt AI as means of technological acceleration and not to fear it. We advocate for effective accelerationism. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, we are interested in building for education and learning. In the future, we plan on extending to puzzle games, utilities and tools, and more.
        <p>
            We are looking for funding and partnerships. If you are aligned with our vision for the future, reach out to <a href = "mailto:aarush@svbrain.xyz">aarush@svbrain.xyz</a>. We are particularly keen on angel investments. If you are a builder that wants to launch with us, our accelerator program will be out of beta soon and dreamers are encouraged to apply. 
        </p>
        <p>We offer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thousands of dollars in credits (AWS, Google Cloud, OpenAI).</li>
            <li>Connections to students, researchers, and deep tech startups from SF and beyond.</li>
            <li>A dense network of 1000+ potential customers interested in new and interesting products.</li>

        <div class = "product">
            <a href = "https://book.lipsti.cc" class = "link_title"><h3>TextbookGPT</h3></a>
            <p><i>Suite of tools off a finetuned LLM for AP World History (500+ users)</i></p>
            <p>
                TextbookGPT is a collection of tools built from scratch (chatbot, summaries, question generator, etc.) for Pearson's AP World History textbook.
            </p>
            <p>
                We've built the data infrastructure and MLOps from scratch and self-host it in our own private server, as a foundation for subsequent products.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're currently at 500+ students and 12,000+ queries/month in ~1.5 months from word of mouth. Planned to sunset on May 15th, the day of the exam.
